Quadris - Written by Jeff Dyck and Sayed Khader

To install: Simply type 'make' and run the quadris executable.

Supported flags:
    -text               Runs the game in text-only mode
    -seed n             Sets the game seed to n. Otherwise you'll 
                        play the game arrangement of pieces every time

The game supports the following commands:

    down, left, right   Moves the piece
    drop                Drops the piece. You must drop to get the next piece
    clockwise           Spins the piece
    counterclockwise
    levelup             Changes the difficulty
    leveldown
    restart             Restarts the game
    rename x y          Sets an alias for command x to y
                        eg 'rename counterclockwise cw'
    n[str]              Runs command [str] n times. 

There is also autocompletion in running the commands. 
ie typing 'dr' will execute the drop command.

Note that there are some graphical glitches in this program because of the simple Xwindow class. It does not redraw the window properly, so depending on how the two windows were initially displayed, certain areas of the window may not update. It should work fine after a few tries, just try to encourage the windows to not spawn on top of each other :)
